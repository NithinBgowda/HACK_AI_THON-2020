Human factor remains the most common cause of road mortality.Traffic signs are an essential part of our day to day lives. They contain critical info that ensures the safety to all the people around us.
Without traffic signs,all the drivers would be clueless about what might be ahead to them and roads can become a mess.
In order to avoid this mess we have come up with the idea of “Traffic Sign Recognition”

The principle of Traffic sign recognition is to detect signs, interpret their meaning, then transmit the information to the driver (by a projection on a windshield, a screen or a smartphone).
