# Farming solution : By agventures #
## Krish-e –android application ##
- Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary    infrastructure.
Getting affected by a disease is very common in plants due to various factors such as fertilizers, cultural practices followed, environmental conditions, etc. These diseases hurt agricultural yield and eventually the economy based on it. 
- Automatic detection of diseases by just seeing the symptoms on the plant leaves make it easier as well as cheaper. 
- Considering the above points we decided to come up with an android appplication that would solve this problem.
- The android application 'krish-e'  developed by our team 'AGVENTURES' would allow farmers to treat their plant diseases. We 
are using Tensorflow library(Machine Learning library) to detect plant disease. The farmers can use their android device to scan a particular 
plant leaf which they suspect for having a plant disease. It analyzes the plant diseases, symptoms etc and then generate proper measures to 
improve plant health.
