# INCLINE

With the current pandemic and the employment rates crashing down, a student who is about to graduate faces a lot of difficulties in order to find a job. The solution to this problem is to work hard and to be the best in what one does. But without proper guidance this becomes very difficult to achieve. In order to do this, we at team Hackoholics have come up with an application that lets the student know how likely he/she is to get placed and what role would be offered to the student with an estimated salary package. It also tells how much a student should work in order to get placed. The application has been embedded with three different models topredict the placement status, roles and package they would be offered. The user enters a survey form while signing in and based on the data collected, the application shows the results to the user. The application has different features like the dashboard, weekly reports and a progress bar. The user tracks his/her progress with the app and becomes industry ready by the time they graduate. Thereby, Incline helps the students not only predict their placement status but also to develop new skills required to get a job.
